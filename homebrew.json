					"Substitutes are constructs made to be better than the humanoids they imitate. They look and act exactly as the species they copy, and in most cases, are exemplary at all tasks they perform. Their true form is a texture of rich red blood that when struck, reacts like hardened clay. Luckily for these disguised constructs, only severe damage is enough to reveal their true nature— an impressive feat unto itself, considering their many defenses. ",
					"The substitute were the concept of a powerful spellcaster from a long-lost bygone era. Texts on their creation are thought to be lost, but several contemporary wizards claim to have unlocked the secret to creating these immensely powerful constructs. Most believe, the secret in their construction lies within further researching simulacrum and similar magic. Whether or not any spellcasters remain alive to create these being is unknown. What is known, is that the substitute live among the settlements of humanity. Perhaps 1 in 200,000 could be one of these hidden constructs, but even that small fear is enough to motivate dedicated hunters and researchers to rooting them out.",
					"Most surviving substitutes are solitary beings, content with being left alone in their mundane existences. They prefer to maintain simple jobs in rural communities. Before their immortality can be called into question, they move to another community, citing reasons like “my brother in the big city is sick, and I’ve got to tend to him.”. Some substitutes even return to towns they’ve previously lived in, often centuries later. When they arrive, they still bear a striking resemblance to the faces on old portraits kept in the dusty and forgotten attics of townsfolk. Regardless of their wandering nature, most substitutes wish no ill upon humanoid races, and instead seek to enrich themselves with repeated lifetimes of experience. ",
					"Eventually, the mundane isn’t enough for a substitute. Some take on the role of adventurers, finding their lifetimes of unexciting jobs give them ample experience for such tasks. Unlike the life of a craftsman, it’s hard for adventuring substitutes to maintain the illusion about their true nature. Substitutes spend long periods of time determining which adventurers would be suitable to learn their true nature. Many times, substitutes abandon their mundane lives to adventure alongside the grown descendant of a friend from a former life, seeking to protect the offspring of those who once showed them kindness.",
					"The oddest actions of substitutes are the inexplicable need to create their own settlements. Settlements founded and run by substitutes are often referred to as false settlements. In these rare situations, several substitutes come together and share their lifetimes of experience, deciding as a group that it would be best if they were entrusted to lead. They use their power and lifetimes of gathered resources to found new settlements, where they take on all the major roles of leadership. In some cases, these false settlements are utopian societies, guided by powerful overseers who refuse to reveal their true nature. In other instances, the substitutes leaders grow tired of living yet another ‘mundane life’ and instead perform twisted social experiments on the people of their settlements. As effectively immortal constructs, many substitutes have run both sides of the spectrum—creating utopias in one millennia, only to create maddening torture towns in another."

											"A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.",
											"Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak."

							"Some legends claim the first ettins were orcs transformed by Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, while others tie their origin to Grolantor or another god of the Ordning. Whatever the truth of their origin, ettins sometimes recognize a kindred soul in the two-headed Demogorgon and devote themselves to his service. Those who prove exceptionally valuable to Demogorgon's purposes in the Material Plane are rewarded with a \"blessing\" that transforms them into monstrous echoes of their demon patron.",
							"The arms of an echo of Demogorgon transform into powerful tentacles, and the heads take on a more bestial appearance. The transformation leaves the echo frenzied with rage; the two heads shout and howl at each other with a fury that resounds with demonic magic, sowing discord and confusion around them. As the echo's monstrous heads roar and bite at each other, nearby creatures are racked with psychic pain or join in the ruckus, attacking their allies."
